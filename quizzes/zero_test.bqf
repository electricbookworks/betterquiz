title: Testing error when answer option is 0

What is the normal total *serum bilirubin* concentration (TSB) in cord blood?
-   0 this zero creates a line break. On its own as an option, it throws an error
+   Less than 35 µmol/l
-   35–55 µmol/l
-   More than 55 µmol/l

What is the normal total *serum bilirubin* concentration (TSB) in cord blood?
-   0 µmol/l
+   Less than 35 µmol/l

What is a safe concentration of inspired oxygen?
-   0.40 (i.e. 40%)
-   0.25 (i.e. 25%)
-   0.10 (i.e. 10%)
+   Any FiO₂ that gives a normal partial pressure or normal saturation of oxygen in the blood

100% oxygen may damage the infant and therefore:
- Should never be given to any infant
- Should not be given for more than 24 hours
+ Should only be given if a lower concentration of oxygen fails to correct central cyanosis
- Should never be given to a preterm infant
